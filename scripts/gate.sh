#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gate.sh -- the one build script. Everything that decides "is this code good enough
# to leave my machine / to merge" runs here, and ONLY here.
#
#   .githooks/pre-push      -> runs this before a push
#   .github/workflows/ci.yml -> runs this on every push and PR
#
# That is the whole point of the file: the local gate and the pipeline cannot drift
# apart, because there is only one of them. (Curriculum 201, Build Scripts: a build
# that only works in one person's environment is not a build.)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/gate.sh                          # sweep placeholders over the whole tree
#   bash scripts/gate.sh --changed-files <path>   # sweep only the paths listed in <path>
#   bash scripts/gate.sh --list                   # print what it would run, run nothing
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every applicable check ran and passed. 1 = something failed, or a
# check that should have run could not run. There is deliberately no third state --
# see "the skip rule" below.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SKIP RULE (read this before you "fix" the script by making it lenient)
#
#   A check that did not run is a FAILED check, not a passed one.
#
# The gate never reports green because it found nothing to do. If a directory has a
# pyproject.toml but no usable interpreter, that is a broken environment and the push
# is blocked. If the whole repo has no project manifest at all but the commits being
# pushed contain source files, that is a misconfigured gate and the push is blocked.
# The only silent pass is a repo that genuinely has no code in it yet.
#
# The earlier version of this gate did the opposite -- it skipped anything it could not
# run, printed "Test gate passed", and let untested code through. That is the defect
# this file exists to make impossible.
